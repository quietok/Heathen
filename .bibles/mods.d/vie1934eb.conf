About=This free Bible is provided to you courtesy of eBible.org.Kinh Thánh The New Testament in the Vietnamese language (1923) Public Domain Language: Tiếng Việt (Vietnamese) Translation by: William Cadman (1883-1948) Contributor: Christian and Missionary Alliance This free Bible is provided to you courtesy of eBible.org. NT first published 1923, OT first published 1925. The New Testament permanently and irrevocably entered the Public Domain on January 1, 2019 due to copyright expiration. The Old Testament will enter the Public Domain on January 1, 2021, if it isn't already there due to failure to comply with formalities earlier (which is likely). This Old Testament will be released on eBible.org in 2021, as by then, there will be no doubt whatsoever about its entry into the Public Domain due to copyright expiration under both U. S. and British law. 2019-02-26
